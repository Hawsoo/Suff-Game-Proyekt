# Suff-Game-Proyekt
This project is going to be a basic game to show off to my classmates, but only if they fall for the illusion that it's awesome... Yeah.
# Schedule
*As far as the schedule will go, here is a basic layout*
### March *(Planning)*
This is the implementation month; *all planning is done* hence the *implementation* month. Systems are set up, and a decent level editor is created for the use of design in later months.
### April *(Visual and Audio)*
This is the design-extension month; graphical overhaul from boxes to things is essential here. I will ~~push the boundaries to~~ create art for this project. So yeah.
### May *(Playtest + Refinement Iterations)*
By now, it will become time to playtest. Uh oh! That's right, if you're one of my friends who have fallen for my trick that this is worthwhile, then you *will* playtest!

Release should happen 'bout here, too, right?
