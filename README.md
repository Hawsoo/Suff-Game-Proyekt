# Suff-Game-Proyekt
This project is going to be a basic game to show off to my classmates, but only if they fall for the illusion that it's awesome... Yeah.
# Schedule
*As far as the schedule will go, here is a basic layout*
### March
This is the implementation month; *all planning is done* hence the *implementation* month. Systems are set up, and a decent level editor is created for the use of design in later months.
### April
This is the design-extension month; graphical overhaul from boxes to things is essential here. I will ~~push the boundaries to~~ create art for this project. So yeah.
### May
By now, it will become time to playtest. Uh oh! That's right, if you're one of my friends who have fallen for my trick that this is worthwhile, then you *will* playtest!

Release should happen 'bout here, too, right?
